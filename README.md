# Digital-Modulation-MATLAB

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for various digital modulation techniques, providing a comprehensive toolbox for digital communication systems. Below is a brief description of each modulation technique implemented in this project:

### ASK Modulation (Amplitude Shift Keying)
ASK modulation is a digital modulation scheme that varies the amplitude of a carrier signal to transmit digital information. The code in this repository demonstrates ASK modulation and includes functionalities for modulation and demodulation.

### Delta Modulation (DM)
Delta modulation is a simple form of analog-to-digital signal conversion. It quantizes the difference between consecutive samples of an analog signal. The repository includes code for delta modulation and demodulation.

### DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation)
Differential pulse code modulation is another method for analog-to-digital signal conversion. It quantizes the difference between the predicted and actual values of the analog signal. The code in this repository covers DPCM encoding and decoding.

### FSK Modulation (Frequency Shift Keying)
FSK modulation transmits digital data by varying the frequency of the carrier signal. This repository includes code for FSK modulation and demodulation.

### PN Sequence (Pseudo-Random Noise Sequence)
PN sequences are sequences of binary values that exhibit pseudo-random properties. The repository provides code for generating PN sequences with different tap configurations (e.g., 3,1 and 5,4,2,1).

### Probability of Error
This section of the code calculates the probability of error for various modulation schemes, helping to analyze and compare their performance.

### PSK Modulation (Phase Shift Keying)
PSK modulation varies the phase of the carrier signal to transmit digital information. The code includes PSK modulation and demodulation techniques.

### QPSK Modulation (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)
QPSK is a variant of PSK that uses four different phase shifts to encode digital data. This repository includes QPSK modulation and demodulation code.
